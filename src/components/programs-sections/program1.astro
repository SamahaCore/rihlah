                        <li><strong>Girls' Halaqa</strong> – A sisters-only circle focused on nurturing faith, character, and sisterhood through meaningful discussions and reflections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boys' Halaqa at PMA</strong> – A brothers-only space designed for young men to learn, ask questions, and grow in a supportive environment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Soulful Pages</strong> – A weekly book club dedicated to reading and reflecting on selected works that deepen our understanding of Islam, spirituality, and the Muslim experience.</li>

                    <p>
                        Each halaqa is an opportunity to connect, learn, and be inspired — leaving with renewed purpose for the week ahead.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Whether you attend regularly or occasionally, the halaqa is a place to recharge your faith, strengthen your bond with fellow believers, and leave you inspired to live with greater purpose. Join us every week for an evening of knowledge, reflection, and spiritual growth.
